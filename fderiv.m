% This function calculates the fractional derivative of order d for the
% given function r(t). It is assumed that the vector r contains the
% samples of the continuous signal r(t) which we are going to calculate its
% fractional derivative. h is a constant and represents the sampling
% period of r(t) (the time period between two samples). h must be small
% enough in the sense of Nyquist sampling theorem.
% y is the result achieved by applying the fractional differentiation
% operator on the input r. This contains the samples of the real output
% y(t) with the same sampling period used for r.
% It makes use of the Grnwald-Letnikov definition. The first element of
% the vector "r", i.e. r(1), is always zero.
